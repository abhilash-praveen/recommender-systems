This repository contains implementations of different recommendation system algorithms using Python.

### 1. BooksRecommendation.ipynb
Book recommendation system that analyzes book ratings and user preferences to provide recommendations based on rating counts and collaborative filtering.

### 2. Movie_Recommendation_KNN.ipynb
Movie recommendation system using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Uses cosine similarity to find similar movies based on user ratings.

### 3. weighted_average.ipynb
Movie recommendation system using weighted average formula (similar to IMDB's rating system). Combines vote averages and popularity scores to generate recommendations.

## Datasets
- Movie datasets: `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`, `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`, `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`
