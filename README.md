# Recommender Systems

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of different recommendation system algorithms using Python.

## Notebooks

### 1. Books_Recommendation.ipynb
Book recommendation system using the Book-Crossing dataset (BX-*). Includes basic analysis and rating-based recommendations.

### 2. Movie_Recommendation_KNN.ipynb
Movie recommendation system using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Uses cosine similarity to find similar movies based on user ratings.

### 3. weighted_average.ipynb
Movie recommendation system using weighted average formula (similar to IMDB's rating system). Combines vote averages and popularity scores to generate recommendations.

### 4. Content Based Recommendation Engines using Python.ipynb
Content-based movie recommendation using TF-IDF on movie overviews (TMDB metadata).

## Datasets
- Movie datasets: `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`, `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`, `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`
- Book dataset: Book-Crossing dataset (BX-Books.csv, BX-Users.csv, BX-Book-Ratings.csv) (download separately)
